REST API extension for Posts 2 Posts plugin


== Description ==

REST API extension for Posts 2 Posts plugin

> This plugin is **NOT** production ready <br/>
> It will work, but it does  **NOT HAVE PERMISSION CHECKS** yet!  <br/>
> So anyone can create, read, update and delete connections using the api endpoints.<br/><br/>
> If you want to dig the code, check the REST controllers and their permission callback methods:
>   * [./src/inc/fun/autoload/class-p2papi_rest_connections_controller.php](https://github.com/jhotadhari/posts-2-posts-api/tree/master/src/inc/fun/autoload/class-p2papi_rest_connections_controller.php)
>   * [./src/inc/fun/autoload/class-p2papi_rest_connection_types_controller.php](https://github.com/jhotadhari/posts-2-posts-api/tree/master/src/inc/fun/autoload/class-p2papi_rest_connection_types_controller.php)
