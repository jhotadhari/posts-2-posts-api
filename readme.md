> This plugin is **NOT** production ready <br/>
> It will work, but it does  **NOT HAVE PERMISSION CHECKS** yet!  <br/>
> So anyone can create, read, update and delete connections using the api endpoints.<br/><br/>
> If you want to dig the code, check the REST controllers and their permission callback methods:
